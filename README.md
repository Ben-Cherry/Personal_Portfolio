# Personal_Portfolio
Outlining the project
The project will contain two pages: index.html & contactMe.html
I will use a script.js file and a style.css file.

Index
On the index page I will have:
    1. An 'about me' section explaining who I am and why I am learning to code.
    2. Two or three examples of previous projects I have done with a screenshot of each page in the project.
    3. A descriptive list of the technologies I have learned.

The index page layout will include:
    - A custom logo in the middle of the navigation bar.
    - A home page button that shows on the left side of the navigation bar (only when in the 'contact me' page).
    - A 'contact me' button on the right side of the navigation bar (only visible when on the home page).
    - The main content.
    - A footer at the bottom with a slogan.

Colour pallet to be used:
    - Navy, silver, white, cyan and red.
