                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Benjamin Cherry. I was born on the 13th of September 2000 in Cheshire, England. I am a huge motorsport fan and a petrolhead. Growing up I always wanted to race cars
                    however, growing up I knew this dream was unrealistic and my family weren't able to provide me with the large resoures that you need to make it in motorsport. So, I turned to
                    my love of creativity, designing and technology. I tailored all of my studies from my GCSE's to my A-Levels around becoming an automotive designer. I wanted to combine my love 
                    for creativity and design with cars. Unfortunately however, the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 started when I began my first year at Swansea Art College studying Automotive 
                    Design. With it being such a creative course, it meant that a lot of my work coud only be completed in the unviersity. And with the buildings closing down, my course was reduced 
                    to online seminars and constant sketching (something I neither enjoy or am talented at; my strengths for layed with physical models and CAD). Therefore, before my first year was 
                    done I decided to remove myself from university and focus on building a stable life for my partner and I. Since leaving university I have built a life for myself with my partner 
                    here in South Wales. We have raised our own dog and made plenty of memories. Now I like to spend my time horse riding, going for walks with our dog and discovering new places.</p>

                <!-- Starting 'Why do I code?' section -->
                <h2>Why did I start to code?</h2>
                <p>Working various jobs from May 2020 to January 2023, I decided something needed to be done sooner rather than later if I wanted to achieve my personal life goals before I was in 
                    my forties. So, I looked into training programs which offered guarranteed employemnt upon completion.
                Some of the things that I want in life are:
                <ul>
                    <li>A long time career which I can move up the ranks and gain many years of experience in.</li>
                    <li>A good salary to enable me to spoiled the ones I love.</li>
                    <li>A job that I enjoy and can fully get involved in. So much so that it's not a chore to go to work and that I don't even see the hours pass.</li>
                    <li>An industry which is constantly evolving where you have to grow with the job and are always learning.</li>
                    <li>Regular working hour times such as 9-5.</li>
                    <li>The ability to possibly work from home.</li>
                </ul>
                Since I like technology and I love design, I knew being a web designer would fit me. I always loved creating websites in college when doing my art projects. I would always try to 
                create a project where I could incorporate one to go alongside the main work. However, I never realised or even thought how websites were created. I knew of coding, but what I didn't 
                know was how much of our technology is thanks to code and the people that write it. And wesbites are no exception to this. Since I started coding I have not looked back or regretted 
                my decision. Although it is difficult to learn how to code alongside a full time job where I regularly do 45+ hours a week, I feel like it is worth it. I love the challenge and seeing 
                my concepts come to life with what I am learning.

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>In this project I was tasked with recreating a static webpage to showcase what I had learnt so far. This project focused mainly on basic HTML5 and CSS - I was still early 
                        into my coding journey at this point so the CSS I was having to use was fairly advanced for me at the time. I was given the image of what they wanted the page to look like, the 
                        resources and media that I would need and some more specific design requirements such as font size and style. Below is a screenshot of the final result.

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>One of my more recent projects was to create a static webpage with a few embedded links for a business, real or made up. I used to manage a virtual race team in a competitve 
                        league called Virgo Dragons. Therefore, I decided to make this as my pretend business for this project. Again, I was given a brief and a design specification sheet to work 
                        with. However, this time, it was far less guided and we got to use our imagination some more. One of the requirements was that we must have a 'staff' section explaining a 
                        little bit about everyone who works at the company and to also have links in the navigation bar that jump to certain sections of the page. You can see the website I created 
                        below:

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>Finally, this project has been the biggest one that I have faced since beginning my course in January 2023. It also happens to be the first one I created. It took roughly 4 
                        weeks from start to finish and countless hours of work. The idea and design of the project was handled by the project leader and this project was used to teach me the 
                        introduction into coding and get a taste of some of the more advanced abilities of coding. There isn't much that I created or wrote solo in this project as I was very much 
                        being taught the ropes by creating this along with a more experinced coder. Despite this, I like to include it as one of my top projects since I feel this project is the one 
                        that took me the largest step. I overcame many, many bugs and learnt the importance of debugging and got to expirence some of the cool things you can create when you become an 
                        experienced coder.

                <p>I created the graphics for my partners pet sitting business. I designed and created each graphic to my partners specification and tweaked it to her liking. I like to show
