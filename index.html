                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Benjamin Cherry. I was born on the 13th of September 2000 in Cheshire, England. I am a huge motorsport fan and a petrolhead. Growing up I always wanted to race cars
                    however, growing up I knew this dream was unrealistic and my family weren't able to provide me with the large resoures that you need to make it in motorsport. So, I turned to
                    my love of creativity, designing and technology. I tailored all of my studies from my GCSE's to my A-Levels around becoming an automotive designer. I wanted to combine my love 
                    for creativity and design with cars. Unfortunately however, the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 started when I began my first year at Swansea Art College studying Automotive 
                    Design. With it being such a creative course, it meant that a lot of my work coud only be completed in the unviersity. And with the buildings closing down, my course was reduced 
                    to online seminars and constant sketching (something I neither enjoy or am talented at; my strengths for layed with physical models and CAD). Therefore, before my first year was 
                    done I decided to remove myself from university and focus on building a stable life for my partner and I. Since leaving university I have built a life for myself with my partner 
                    here in South Wales. We have raised our own dog and made plenty of memories. Now I like to spend my time horse riding, going for walks with our dog and discovering new places.</p>

                <!-- Starting 'Why do I code?' section -->
                <h2>Why did I start to code?</h2>
                <p>Working various jobs from May 2020 to January 2023, I decided something needed to be done sooner rather than later if I wanted to achieve my personal life goals before I was in 
                    my forties. So, I looked into training programs which offered guarranteed employemnt upon completion.
                Some of the things that I want in life are:
                <ul>
                    <li>A long time career which I can move up the ranks and gain many years of experience in.</li>
                    <li>A good salary to enable me to spoiled the ones I love.</li>
                    <li>A job that I enjoy and can fully get involved in. So much so that it's not a chore to go to work and that I don't even see the hours pass.</li>
                    <li>An industry which is constantly evolving where you have to grow with the job and are always learning.</li>
                    <li>Regular working hour times such as 9-5.</li>
                    <li>The ability to possibly work from home.</li>
                </ul>
                Since I like technology and I love design, I knew being a web designer would fit me. I always loved creating websites in college when doing my art projects. I would always try to 
                create a project where I could incorporate one to go alongside the main work. However, I never realised or even thought how websites were created. I knew of coding, but what I didn't 
                know was how much of our technology is thanks to code and the people that write it. And wesbites are no exception to this. Since I started coding I have not looked back or regretted 
                my decision. Although it is difficult to learn how to code alongside a full time job where I regularly do 45+ hours a week, I feel like it is worth it. I love the challenge and seeing 
                my concepts come to life with what I am learning.
